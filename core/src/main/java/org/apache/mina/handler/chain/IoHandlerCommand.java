 * a {@link IoHandlerChain}, which allows them to either complete the

 * <p>{@link IoHandlerCommand} implementations typically retrieve and store state

 * the {@link #execute(NextCommand,IoSession,Object)} method, using custom
 * session attributes.  If you think getting attributes is tedious process,
 * you can create a bean which contains getters and setters of all properties
 * and store the bean as a session attribute:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class MyContext {
 *   public String getPropertyX() { ... };

 *   public int getPropertyZ() { ... };
