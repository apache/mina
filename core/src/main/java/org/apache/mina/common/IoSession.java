/**
 * A handle which represents connection between two endpoints regardless of 
 * transport types.
 * <p>
 * {@link IoSession} provides user-defined attributes.  User-defined attributes
 * are application-specific data which is associated with a session.
 * It often contains objects that represents the state of a higher-level protocol
 * and becomes a way to exchange data between filters and handlers.
 * 
 * <h3>Adjusting Transport Type Specific Properties</h3>
 * <p>
 * You can simply downcast the session to an appropriate subclass.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Thread Safety</h3>
 * <p>
 * {@link IoSession} is thread-safe.  But please note that performing
 * more than one {@link #write(Object)} calls at the same time will
 * cause the {@link IoFilter#filterWrite(IoFilter.NextFilter, IoSession, IoFilter.WriteRequest)}
 * is executed simnutaneously, and therefore you have to make sure the
 * {@link IoFilter} implementations you're using are thread-safe, too.
