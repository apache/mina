 * An {@link IoSession} for broadcast transports. (e.g. UDP broadcast or multicast)

 * <h2>Writing Back to the Broadcasting Server</h2>
 * <p>
 * When you implement a client that receives a broadcast message from a server
 * such as DHCP server, the client might need to send a response message for the
 * broadcast message the server sent.  Because the remote address of the session
 * is not the address of the server in case of broadcasting, there should be a
 * way to specify the destination when you write the response message.
 * This interface provides {@link #write(Object, SocketAddress)} method so you
 * can specify the destination.
