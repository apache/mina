/**
 * A filter which intercepts {@link IoHandler} events like Servlet
 * filters.  Filters can be used for these purposes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Event logging,</li>
 *   <li>Performance measurement,</li>
 *   <li>Authorization,</li>
 *   <li>Overload control,</li>
 *   <li>Message transformation (e.g. encryption and decryption, ...),</li>
 *   <li>and many more.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Please NEVER implement your filters to wrap
 * {@link IoSession}s.</strong> Users can cache the reference to the
 * session, which might malfunction if any filters are added or removed later.
 * 
 * <h3>The Life Cycle</h3>
 * {@link IoFilter}s are activated only when they are inside {@link IoFilterChain}.
 * <p>
 * When you add an {@link IoFilter} to an {@link IoFilterChain}:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #init()} is invoked by {@link IoFilterChain} if the filter is
 *       added at the first time.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onPreAdd(IoFilterChain, String, NextFilter)} is invoked to notify
 *       that the filter will be added to the chain.</li>
 *   <li>The filter is added to the chain, and all events and I/O requests
 *       pass through the filter from now.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onPostAdd(IoFilterChain, String, NextFilter)} is invoked to notify
 *       that the filter is added to the chain.</li>
 *   <li>The filter is removed from the chain if {@link #onPostAdd(IoFilterChain, String, org.apache.mina.common.IoFilter.NextFilter)}
 *       threw an exception.  {@link #destroy()} is also invoked if the filter
 *       is the last filter which was added to {@link IoFilterChain}s.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * When you remove an {@link IoFilter} from an {@link IoFilterChain}:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #onPreRemove(IoFilterChain, String, NextFilter)} is invoked to
 *       notify that the filter will be removed from the chain.</li>
 *   <li>The filter is removed from the chain, and any events and I/O requests
 *       don't pass through the filter from now.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onPostRemove(IoFilterChain, String, NextFilter)} is invoked to
 *       notify that the filter is removed from the chain.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #destroy()} is invoked if the removed filter was the last one.</li>
 * </ol>
